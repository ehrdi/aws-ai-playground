# Google Play Store Review Sentiment Analysis
<!-- section: Introduction -->
<!-- Describe briefly what your software is. What problem does it solve? At what target audience is it aimed? -->

This is a sample project for the AWS Comprehend. This service is capable of performing sentiment analysis, key word extraction, language inferring and many more. This sample project illustrates sentiment analysis in particular. It downloads the latest reviews for an app on the google play store and analysis whether the reviews are written in a positive, negative, neutral or mixed way (i.e. positive and negative aspects). It summarizes its findings by showing the distribution of the classes and gives the maximum and minimum value of the given class. Finally it exports reviews and their respective sentiments to a file called `result.json`.
